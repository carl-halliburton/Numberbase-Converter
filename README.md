# Numberbase-Converter
A small Java app that converts between Binary, Decimal, Octel and Hexidecimal.  This was originally palnned asn assignemnt for a java course I was taking at WelTec in Wellington New Zealand.  I ended up working on it in my own time. 
IT allows you to convert between binary, decimal, octel and hexiecimal.  you select the inout base and the output base enter the number usung the onscreen keyboard.  it will display the results on the right of the application.  as this moment it works, I have not done extensive exaustive testing of it at this point in time.
